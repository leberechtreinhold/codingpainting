*Seas of Honor was a PC game about naval combat in the XVIIIth.*

## Features

As of the latest prototype, the game includes the following:

- Simulation of sail ships in the sea, considering multiple wind factors, sail types, sea parameters, weight distribution and hull design.

- Each ship can be controlled by changing rudder position, each sail individually furled and angled.

- A shooting and damage model based on custom controlled physics using things like secondary UV map lookup.

- Custom shader for sails, hulls and water. These allowed to portray different damage states, aesthethic changes like heraldry or colors, dampness in case of rain and snow. The weather particle system and the sky is based on Enviro, a Unity asset.

- World map generation using tiles with different cities to move between.

## History

Back in 2016, a friend and I started to get into gamedev. After a few attempts we decided to make a pirate game into the vein of Akella's games, a genre which has been largely untaped in the last decade. Since the two of us were programmers, we started to make all the systems with placeholder assets. A few months later we talked Christian Lehn, a very talented artist which was also very interested in ships, who worked with us as a freelancer creating ships. With his ships we started iterating better, adding shaders, visual details, better hull systems modeling, etc. However, due to a personal family problem he had to stop working. For more than a year, we hired several freelancers to create a ship for us, but we never found an adequate replacement. We ended up scrapping the project because we could not afford to keep the search at the same time we also had our normal work and coding the game itself.
