*Title design for a DBA book*

<!--more--> 

I'm preparing a book on playing campaigns for DBA, and I decided to go full medieval on the design. To illustrate each title, I have created a small history using "killer bunnies". That may sound ridiculous, but in medieval marginalia, [that's not uncommon](https://sexycodicology.net/blog/medieval-killer-bunny/). In fact, [weirder things happen](https://sexycodicology.net/blog/killer-bunny-vacation/). The drawings are inspired by the Royal 10 E IV manuscript, which has been digitzed by the British Library.
