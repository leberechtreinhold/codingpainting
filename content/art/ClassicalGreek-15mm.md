*Classical Greek army for DBA 2.2, 15mm, mostly AB and Xyston*

<!--more--> 

Army for a variety of DBA 2.2 Classical Greek armies, centered around the Pelopponesian War. Since there was no uniformity during the classical era, they could be form any polis. Of course, spartiates would be different, with the more common lambda symbol on the shield, long hair and possible more use of red. In this case I have excluded the lakaedamonians and have used a variety of designs. Shields are mostly based on historical ones. [This was a great reference](http://lukeuedasarson.com/Greek_shield_patterns_1.html). Note that I have added several invented designs, some of them typically associated to cities, like tridents representing mercenaries from Mantinean.

A small detail I have added is that the leader has his helm golden plated, like the [famous artifact found in Israel](https://www.livescience.com/18700-ancient-helmet-greek-warrior.html).

All the hoplites are AB, except the dead one and the generals which are Xyston. Rest of the minis (light infantry and cavalry) are also Xyston.

*Light infantry, Peltast and Psiloi. Yeah... sometimes they were really light.*

*While cavalry wasn't really a prestigious unit in ancient Greece, their role was key, both in scouting and during the battle, covering the hoplite formations.*
