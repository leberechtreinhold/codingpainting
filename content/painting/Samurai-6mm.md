A small army of Sengoku Samurai fopr Basic Impetvs II. It's actually bigger than what the list requires to allow for more options (or playing with bigger armies once Impetvs II releases!).

This army represents the Ii forces around 1600 (Sekigahara), although they are not representing any specific battle. Since making everything from the same clan would look a bit weird, I have added some troops from fictional clans to add some color variety.
