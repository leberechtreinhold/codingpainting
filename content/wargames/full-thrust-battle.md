*Game between two 1500 point fleets (alien vs human), custom spaceships.*

<!--more--> 

This is an old game from 2015, but we think it was pretty cool so I decided to upload it. We had a time were FT was going strong in our group, and we even made a small league out of it. This is the last game, with both fleets painted. We are using FT: Cross Dimensions + FT: Continuum, with all construction rules available. The only limitations were no gunboats (we didn't like them, and they are a bit broken), and -1DRM to fighters, as many recommend. The scenario itself is a modification of the Battlefleet Gothic battles.

The scenario had a asteroid field on the center, and a small planet in a corner. The alien deployed in a wedge formation, but the human used sphere so it envolved him. The capital alien ship was in the center, with cruisers behind, while the human puts a capital and a cruiser on the left flank, and a cruiser and three destroyers on the right. Note that we are using radar markers, they are not unveiled until you get to 24". This menas that the rival knows the place of the ships and class, but not equipment!

## Setup

Primero ponemos la escenografía de forma aleatoria, resultando en un planeta menor en una esquina y un campo de asteroides en el centro, hacia el borde humano. Dado que el alien usa cuña y el humano esfera, el aliente coloca sus naves en el centro en una línea de batalla, con su nave capital en el centro. El humano pone una capital y un crucero en el flanco izquierdo, y un crucero y tres destructores en el derecho.

## Start

The alien fleet advances to the left flank, clearly trying to kill one fleet before both human fleets converge, and then dealing with the capital human ship alone. This allows the human player to get the flank easily, but now it evolves in a chase against time. In the first turn, all ships advance slowly, while the bigger ones deploy their fighters. In the sencd turn the hostilities commence: the human launches a brutal missile salvo that overwhelms point defense systems and fighters. However the alien hivemind already predicted the move, so very intelligently launched a small frigate forward, which sacrificed and shielded the rest of the fleet. Fighters start between each other, and the superiority of the human fighters is clear.

## Fight!

The human, with a small range advantage, fires as much as it can, while slowing down, trying to win time until the reinforcements arrive. The alien player then unveils it's own missile salvo, although smaller than the human salvo. One of the destroyer falls, and the cruiser suffers heavy damage. Further fire from the aliens eventually remove the cruisers. However, the humans don't go without fighting first, and they remove one of the light alien cruisers and damaging the shields of the alien dreadnought - which eventually be the key of the battle.

Seeing that the human is advancing in the flank - now rear, the alien starts to slow down, to facilitate a turn around while they sweep clean the rest of the human fleet. At this range, the fire is direct and very strong! The only human ship remaining ended up being a destroyer with a critical failure on the nuclear reactor core! Any turn now it could expldoe. However, the alien destroyers started suffering heavy damage and some losses, and even the huge alien ship was now without any kind of shields, some weapons removed and the engines starting to fail. The regenerative armor is not enough at this range and level of firepower, and cannnot keep up!

However, on the fifth turn, the human reinforcements have arrived. The aliens have managed to almost wipe the other half of the fleet, but the damage is high. All crew on board is trying to repair weapons and prepare for the fight against a fresh human battleship and cruisers.

# End

The humans start the fire before the alien engines are even fully repaired. And the firepower of the human battleship is no joke: the big alien destroyer is slain, cut in half with sheer laser fire. The response from the aliens before going down is not enough to compensate, due to their weapons being damaged and only being left with some close ranged weaponry. The human cruiser suffers some light damage, but the human battleship is still clean. The human destructor tries to move away in the case of a big nuclear disaster.

The last remaining alien ship, with the hope of inflicting the most damage, tries to charge straight into the human ranks, however, is brought down before it can do anything.
