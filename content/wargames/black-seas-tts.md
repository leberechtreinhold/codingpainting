*A fully scripted visual mod for Black Seas*

<!--more--> 

Due to the pandemic I have created a mod for Black Seas, the game created by Warlord games about ship combat in the XVIII-XIXth. Note that to play this game, you do require the original rulebook! It's not included in the mod. The mod is very feature complete and has a lot of shaders and fancy particles that should make the games more visually impacting (and easier to play), 

You can see the trailer here:

You can see me playing with Arkein a super big scenario, the Siege of Malta, here:
