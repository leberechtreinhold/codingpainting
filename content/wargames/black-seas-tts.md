I have created a mod for playing Black Seas on Tabletop Simulator. This is more complete than my DBA mod, and features much complex graphics, including custom shaders for sails that get damaged and the water effects.

You can see the trailer here:

You can see me playing with Arkein a super big scenario, the Siege of Malta, here:

No open source this time, since the licensing for some of the ship models, which are bought, don't allow it (the code has references to the urls where you could download the models... which you can rip from TTS but oh well, legally I cannot distribute). However, if there's interest, I could upload a version to github without the URLs, it won't run but you could see the overall structure. Similarly if someone is interested in the shaders I can share them.
