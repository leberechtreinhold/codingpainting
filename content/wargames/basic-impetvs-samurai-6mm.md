*Battle between two Samurai Armies using the new version of Basic Immpetvs*

<!--more--> 

In this small game of Basic Impetvs 2, with both players being new to the system, we play a mostly symmetrical battle between two armies. Since BI2 doesn't have a point system, we used the one found in the old impetvs system to balance things out.

In this case, the defender was red and the attacker blue. The battlefield was a plain, with a big forest in the middle and some arable fields outside the main engagement zone. The attacker deployed everything on one side of the forest, while red left his general on foot on the other side.

*Both armies start closing in each other*

The combat starts with the blue samurai general charging ahead of its infantry against the teppo line. The rest of the infantry starts closing in but it's harassed by the red light skirmishers.

*He eventually brokes through, but he is far from his troops*

The blue general starts moving and regrouping, but his main troops are suffering a lot of casualties due to the constant teppo barrage combined with the skirmisher support. Most importantly, the blue samurais have a lot of casualties and can't sustain a battle line.

*Main battle line is formed*

The blue ashigarus in the center push the teppos back, which are protected by some skirmishers that keep the now very heavily damaged blue general out of the fight. Howver on the left flank, the arrival of the red general plus their own troops finally breaking through, makes for a tough situation for the center of the blue forces, which are now surrounded and damaged. After some more musketry, the blue forces surrender.
