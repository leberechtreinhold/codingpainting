*A 3-page reference with the most used information in DBA matches, including some statistics*

<!--more--> 

A continuation of my statistics post, I have created a small Quick Reference Sheet with the most important information for playing, plus a single page with the stats. Lots of new people in the club excited for DBA, so I think this can be a very useful reference for all of us.
