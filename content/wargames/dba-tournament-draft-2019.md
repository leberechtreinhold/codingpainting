Spanish tournament, so the rest of the post is in Spanish ;)

On November 17 we played some great DBA games. The system was a draft, created by the people opf Bele Beltzak in Altsasua. In this system, each player receives each 12 cards, each representing a DBA base, and choose one of the cards and passes the rest to the player on his right, and receives 11 from the player on his left. Players continue gettings cards until they all have an army of 12. We did some modifications to add depth, so the aggresiveness depended on troops, and and to make some combinations some historical according to the theme.

Speaking of theme, it was the Lamian War. We chose 18 generals, each with his own general and campament base specifically for him, and a card explaining his background. Given the high number of players (18! and we had two failing to make it), we had to create some non-historical ones, since the war was a relatively minor rebellion. You can find all material from cards to sheets to poster (in which Achilles and Ajax play DBA) in this zip that you can download [here](https://cloud.ajimenez.es/index.php/s/dEe95z4p8Jf28jT). Note that it is 100MB compressed.

The games went fairly smoothly and with the exception of one match everyone ended on time. The start was a bit late due to preparing all the bases for the players and organize such a large draft but overall, it was great. 

The food was organized by Napargar and our club member Arkein, which prepared traditional historical food. Sadly, I didn't took photos other than an overall shot of all the players on the eating table, meander style :)

Thanks to everyone for coming and we hope to repeat again!
