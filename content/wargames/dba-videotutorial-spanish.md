*How to play DBA 2.2, in video format (Spanish language only)*

<!--more--> 

Due to popular request, we have created a couple of videos showing how to play De Bellis Antiquitatis 2.2. It's a simple ruleset, old, but quite dry and the rulebook doesn't contain nearly enough examples. However with another human is very easy, so thanks to Arkein and the group [La Historia en Guerra](https://es-es.facebook.com/lahistoriaenguerra/), and [Napargar](https://es-es.facebook.com/Napargar/)

Part One: Shows all the basics, enough to start playing
