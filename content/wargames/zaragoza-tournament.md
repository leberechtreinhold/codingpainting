*This 19 January in Zaragoza, the guys at [Atalaya Vigia](https://www.facebook.com/asociacionatalayavigia) organized another DBA tournament. As usual, the organization was perfect, and it had a great participation (24!).*

The place was great, on the outskirts of Zaragoza. We shared room with a 60-ish people 40k Tournament.

The prizes were no joke! Plenty of those were given randomly, although obviously the biggest one, the ham, was for the first place.

Regarding the games themselves, I used my Seleucid army. I feel they are not as good as my late Medieval French, becuase they cannot deal with difficult terrain at all (only 2 units of Psoloi, no Auxilia, no Blades, no Spear, no Warband... etc). However I kind of like how I painted them and... TWO ELEPHANTS! That's awesome and even better than one elephant!

In the first round, I played against a Bedouin army. Lots of cavalry and specially light cavalry, with some camels. He rushed fast against me, but I used a hard hill on my flank to put pressure with psioloi, and start eating their troops from there.

Next, against Eien. He was also playing another of the Alexander successors, in this case, Cassandro. Our armies were very similar, he had more light troops like cavalry and auxilias, but didn't have the scythed chariot. He played very well putting pressure on my flank, and I had a distraous defeat.

Third round, last before lunch. I played against a very beautiful Saladin army. The game was a close match, and when I started winning the flank and was getting ready to eat everything with the elephants, my Knight general was killed by his Cavalry general. After that disaster, I couldn't move my troops well enoguh and well.. I lost. Great game.

Fourth round, after eating... the slowest game, because we ate a lot :D He was using another sucessor, Ptolomeo. He was defending and placed the coast on the right flank. He also reserved a lot of light infantry, with the idea of using the mountains to flank me. I just did a inverted L formation and defended very slowly everything, waiting for them to come to me. The game was fairly close, but I eventually managed to win.

Fifth and final round, this one triggers PTSD. Chinese army with plenty of early guns, two pieces of artillery, and some blades to defend. This was super hard, so I put pressure with the elefants and some psiloi on his left flank, and try to start eating while I give the other flank as lost. I won, but my general could have died easily and it was a very risky game. I was even risking charges just so I couldn't be shot!

Surprisingly I ended up 4th, and only at one point from the third! Very fun tournament.
