*A small book for playing campaigns using the DBA system.*

<!--more--> 

After way too many months of delays, we have finally finished the Campaign Manual for DBA.

It's a small book that will aid anyone trying to create a campaign in DBA. In the same vein as DBA, the system is very abstract and simplified, it aims to create battles with context but not become a game within a game. It should also fit most of the periods referenced in DBA.

The campaign is grid-based, and you move armies between the nodes, fight if there's enemies in proximity, take cities, and eventually take the enemy capital if you muster enough force.
