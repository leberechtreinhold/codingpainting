# The game

This is a summary of the game played last sunday (31 July 2022). The game had two umpires and 5 player commands, some of them with multiple players, commanding the same division. The game lasted about 6 hours. The ruleset was custom, you can see all rules and detailed info about it below. If you are interested in more info, from the order sheets, to the blender files used for the briefings, feel free to contact me.

I'm sorry I don't have many images of the game itself, running everything gets pretty intense, especially this kriegsspiel as it had a heavy roleplaying component, so I didn't have much time.

# The mission

The planet Ix is key for the Kuat system, which is one of the main providers for the Imperial Fleet. Manufacturing all kind of electronic components that are key for a ship's systems, all the cities in the planet, and particularly its highly educated population, are of high value for the Empire. Because of this, Kuat has been attacked before by Rebel forces after Yavin, but so far they had no success. However, after the battle of Endor and with the Rebels spearheading the New Republic, its importance its bigger than ever.

This scenario takes place in the capital of Ix, Safwan:

Imperial briefing (Spanish audio): https://youtu.be/l7q2T-Db1ro

"Your mission is to secure Safwan from Rebel hands. The Imperial Governor shall collaborate will all the Planetary Defence Forces, while the 3rd Infantry Division  and the 101st Assault Division will deploy from orbit with fleet support. We know the approximate location of the main rebel base, but there will be more nearby. The enemy will have defences ready, so you must proceed carefully with deployment due to AA fire."

Rebel briefing (Spanish audio): https://youtu.be/xRRhQYtw2MM
 
"Your mission is to lay a trap to Imperial forces. You will have ample forces available, with the VII and IV Corps. First, you will have to lure the maximum number of Imperial troops, forcing them to land. The Imperial Governor is actually in negotiations with the New Republic, and once she announces a new alliance, the Rebel fleet with jump on the Imperial, trapping all Imperial troops on the planet." 

# First moves

The rebels decide to deploy their troops dispersed through the mountains in the north face of both valleys, with the sourthern valley containing the larger force including both Corps's HQ. The Imperial Governor deploys her troops through the city, with some of them in the external assets: with the 3rd battalion of the Safwan Brigade in the dam to the north, and the Marine Brigade on the southern one. However, when one of the Marine battalions was patrolling near the dam, it was attacked by artillery from the 13th Armor Regiment from Rebel forces, which was mobilizing all their troops on the south.

The battle begins on the northwest: ISF (Imperial Special Forces) infiltrated previously on the planet and noted some AA positions and the Rebel 69th Infantry Regiment, notifying the fleet of the positions to deploy from orbit without risk from AA. 3rd division deploys on the plains on the south, taking all main roads near the capital, while the 101st starts deploying west, supported by TIEs and assaulting the poorly defended AA battery.

# Northern Assault

Seeing the weakness of Rebel positions on the Northwest, the Imperial forces continue to deploy and take the valley, with the Imperial 327th Airborne Regiment attacking through the north and several 3rd Division elements supporting from the sourth. Eastern Rebel forces start to mobilize, but they do hidden through the mountain, which slows down their advance. In the air, both sides keep sending all their fighters in a crazy, continuously scalating, furball.

The Imperial Governor, seeing the situation and the lack of support from Rebel forces, summons all troops back to the inner city, while deploying all troops on the border to avoid any incursion from Rebel forces. Imperial commanders from the 3rd and 101st Divisions request reports from the Governor, but they get no proper response other than "all going OK", so they start to suspect from her, while watching out city borders.

Meanwhile, in the south, the Rebel 13th Armored continues to press forward chasing the Marine brigade which is now retreating to the city.

# Betrayal and destruction of the central dam

The Admiral in charge of the 101st deploys on the planet on board of the Raider Aquila, a special planet-assault ship armed with jammers which disrupt communications at distances longer than 50km. This has great impact on the Rebel forces, which had both their HQ hidden on the remote southern corner. Without any way to communicate with the main forces on the frontlines, they take vehicles from the Rebel 32th Infantry Regiment, and start advancing to the city.

Seeing herself isolated, the Imperial Governor announces the new pledge of loyalty to the New Republic, calling all troops to follow her before Imperial troops decide to enter the city. The response from the Imperial commanders is immediate: the 101st Admiral places his Raider over the Imperial Palace and starts a direct bombing, while the Imperial 83th Stormtrooper Regiment from the the 3rd Division starts the demolition of the central dam. This means the destruction of the Marine brigade as well as two tank battalions from Rebel 13th Armored Regiment.

Chaos regins in the city: in the industrial port two battalions of the Safwan brigade fight each other, police keeps loyalty, but the Industrial Security from a nearby factory raises arms. The 10th Stormtrooper regiment keeps mostly loyalty to the Empire, but some of them help the Governor, which is now fleeing the Imperial Palace in a city partially flooded and unrest.

# Battle for Safwan

The city is an excellent defensive position, but the newly turned Rebel troops are far between. The forces of the Imperial 327th Regiment continue fighting against the Rebel 69, while the full Imperial 3rd Division turns around and advances on the south to take the city. In the streets, Industrial Security forces have proven themselves by pushing police back and inflicting lots of casualties, but the personal Governor forces are much superior. The Governor herself isn't commanding her troops and abandons them, trying to disguise as a civilian and fleeing in the streets.

Meanwhile, in the air battle, the Rebels are proving themselves to be superior thanks to the relatively low number of TIE/Interceptors, and while Hound Squadron (A-Wings) pick up their HQs on their southern valley, the rest lead the charge against the Imperial Raider Aquila.

# The Empires secures positions

Despite urban fighting being a slow and costly enterprise, the massive numerical, weapon and training superiority of the Imperial forces is too much for the Rebel forces, especially when the rest of the Imperial 101st Division joins the operations. Imperial 3rd Division command moves some regiments to take up defenses in the northern valley, while others are ordered to provide search and rescue and other civilian support operations, while proclaiming the flood to be caused by Rebel terrorists.

In the air however, the Empire is in trouble. The Imperial Raider Aquila finally falls to the streets of Safwan, and with him, the Admiral of the 101st Division. The Governor, which was trying to flee as a civilian, now seizes the opportunity and signals one of the A-Wing squadrons to help her.

# Battle for the Northern Dam

Despite their dire situation, the Rebels do not give up. While Imperial forces take up the northern valley, the Rebels try to distract and skirmish them from the forest in the mountains, all while a battalion of Rebel 7th Armor Regiment starts fire on the northern dam, with some support from the starfighters. However, they are stopped by the ISF which deploy from the air in a desperate attempt. With all the Imperial troops now exiting the city and securing positions, the Rebel forces cannot sustain themselves and start to flee to other bases.
