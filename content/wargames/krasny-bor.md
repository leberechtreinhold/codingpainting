After Action Report
--------------------

Situation: 10 February 1943. The siege of Leningrad (St Petersburg) is advacing slowly, but the Russians don't have too much time. Thanks to the frozen Ladoga lake and river, they have been able to barely supply the city. On Dec-Jan. 1943 the URSS launched Operation Iskra, which cut the germans out of Ladoga and any communication with Finland. After that, they launched a much more ambitious plan, Operation Polar Star, in which the 55th Soviet Army would attack the siege from the south and from there a new offensive would be launched to Estonia. Emilio Esteban Infantes, from the Spanish Blue Division, saw the buildup of the 55th Army and decided to mount a defense on Krasny Bor, a urban area key for the operation. This is a refight using the Rommel wargame, in which the fight will be somewhat simplified (first time with this ruleset!).

12:00 In the south, russians take almost everything, with the Panzergrenadiers reagrouping in Krasny Bor. The Stugs on the north are mounting an impressive defense, and russian tanks are suffering a lot trying to take this flank.

14:00 Eventually russians overwhelm the north and south flank, not without a lot of loses. A few tanks escape to the city and start coordinating a defense behind spanish lines.

16:00 The spanish, which have been preparing defenses all day, defend against the constant russian attacks, which were already weakened by the german vanguard. After several assaults, they give up.
